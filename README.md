## Description
Python software package for standardized processing Doppler wind lidar data. (Note: the client is currently only applicable to Halo Photonics systems, but will be updated for Leosphere systems soon)

<a name="usage"/></a>
## Usage
1.	Go to the directory where the package is located and install the client via `pip install`. If installation was not successful, please contact Markus.Kayser@dwd.de
  
2.	After the successful installation the client can be used through parsing the following commands:

	You need to specify a valid date with either `-d` or `-date` and a command to execute with `-c` or `-cmd`.
	The following commands are valid:
		- `hpl_l1` creates a daily netCDF file of lvl1 .hpl-files.
		- `l1_l2` processes a daily lvl1 netCDF file according to the VAD retrieval described in PÃ¤schke et al. [2015].
		- `hpl_l1_l2` creates daily lvl1 and lvl2 netCDF files from .hpl-files.
        Note: In case of lvl2 processing you can add `...wql` to the command to create quicklooks.
	You have to specify a custom configuration file in order for the routines to locate .hpl-files and give directories of lvl1 	and lvl2 netCDFs as well as of quicklooks.
    
    The routines will create a data path corresponding to the path specified in the configuration file plus the time 		information, i.e. `yourpath/YYYY/YYYYMM`.
	This is done with the command `-u` or `-url`, followed by the path to the configuration file, including the file name.

### Example on how to use the hpl2netCDF client

		`hpl2netCDF-client -u "configuration file" -d "specify date as YYYY-MM-DD" -c "cmd"`
